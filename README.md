# Facial Emotion Music Player

## Overview
The Facial Emotion Music Player is an innovative music recommendation system that takes into account the user's facial emotions, preferred language, and favorite singer to curate a personalized playlist on YouTube. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model detects the user's facial emotions in real-time and suggests music that matches their mood.

##Features

###Language & Singer Preferences: Users can specify their preferred language and singer to further refine the recommendations.
###Real-Time Emotion Detection: Utilizes Mediapipe's facial and hand landmarks to capture and analyze facial expressions in real-time.
###Streamlit Deployment: The model is deployed on Streamlit, providing an intuitive and interactive user interface.
###Seamless YouTube Integration: Once the emotion is detected and preferences are set, the player opens a corresponding playlist or song directly on YouTube.
